  {
    q: "What happens after I send the form?",
    a: "We'll review your message, ask any clarifying questions, and come back with a rough scope and indicative price — at no cost and no obligation.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you work with businesses outside the UK?",
    a: "Yes — we work worldwide. We have clients across Europe, North America, and Asia. Everything is done remotely and asynchronously where needed.",

    q: "How much does a project typically cost?",
    a: "It varies by scope. A Shopify store typically starts from £3,000–£8,000. An AI agent from £2,500–£6,000. Custom builds and enterprise work are scoped individually. We'll give you a fixed price before we start anything.",

    q: "Can I get an NDA before we talk?",
    a: "Yes, absolutely. Just mention it in the form and we'll send one over before the discovery call.",
